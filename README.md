I'm a Swiss researcher in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, working at the intersection of
dynamical systems, reservoir computing, self-supervised learning, and simulation-based inference.

My work combines theoretical and applied machine learning, scientific computing, and visual tools for
research and education. I focus on models that are understandable, controllable, and grounded in physical
or dynamical principles, with a strong commitment to free and open-source AI (FOSAI & FOSS).

## Research interests

- **Reservoir Computing** (RC) & **Echo State Networks** (ESN)
- **Self-Supervised Learning** (SSL): contrastive and regularized learning (JEPA)
- Physics-informed, neural operators for **simulation-based inference** (SBI) 
- Visual computing & generative effects for arts and education 

## Selected projects

- **Artificialis**: a YouTube channel exploring artificial intelligence through code, mathematics, and critical thinking, without ignoring its philosophical, artistic, and social dimensions.
- **EchoTorch**: a **Python toolkit for Reservoir Computing** and Echo State Network experimentation built on top of PyTorch.
- **Pixel Prism**: a Python library for mathematical education with **advanced visual effects** and **symbolic mathematics**.
- **Hyperion**: an **educational deep learning stack** aimed at demystifying modern ML systems.
- **DeckPilot** – customizable Stream Deck interface for scripting and automation  
- **Tempest** – CUDA-accelerated engine for full waveform inversion and scientific modeling  
- **boardGPT** – lightweight experiments around training/fine-tuning GPT-like models on structured games and languages for AGI.

## Background

- PostDoc Researcher in Machine Learning & AI  
- Experience across academia, applied research, and open-source development  
- Strong background in **Python, C++, CUDA**, and scientific ML tooling
