I'm a Swiss researcher in **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence**, with a strong focus on
**dynamical systems, reservoir computing, self-supervised learning (SSL) and Simulation-Based Inference (SBI)**.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- theoretical and applied machine learning  
- ML applied to science
- creative and visual AI tools for scientific education

I care about models that are understandable, controllable, and grounded in physical or dynamical principles,
with a strong emphasis on **open models**, **open implementations**, and FOSAI (Free and Open Source Artificial Intelligence).
